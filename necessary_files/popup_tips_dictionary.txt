write_yields_button & This operation makes a fast call to Gosia to evaluate which transitions can be reproduced by Gosia, and then writes only the yield data which can be reproduced to the Gosia-format yield file.\nAfter writing the yield data, you can begin one of the following operations:\n1.  Select "Integrated yields" and "Run Gosia input" to generate predicted yield data for comparison with the experimental yields.\n2.  Set fit parameters (matrix elements to fit to the yield data) using the "Fit parameters" button.\n(The Gosia function and action ("run," "view," or "save") are selected in the pull-down tabs to the left of the "Go" button.)\nIf an error is returned when attempting to write the yield data file, then the matrix and/or experimental setup may not be completely defined.  You can complete the matrix setup by making sure that you have matrix elements coupling at least the first several states (button "Add/change m.e."), including the initial and final states of the transition you wish to use to normalize all data.  Refer to topic "normalizationtransition" in the Help button menu.


after_integrated_yields & The "integrated yields" are the predicted gamma-ray intensities integrated over the scattering ranges defined by each particle detector and integrated over each Ge detector.  This calculation includes the Coulomb excitation probabilities and the decay intensities with the true laboratory-frame angular distributions that depend on the scattering angle ranges, deorientation, motion of the emitting particle, etc.\nAfter running an "integrated yields" calculation, you can examine and plot calculated gamma-ray yields (and experimental data, if they are in memory) by setting the initial and final bands to select transitions in the "Initial/final band" entries and clicking the "Plot yields" button.

after_fit & The fit function will fit all matrix elements designated as fit parameters (using the "Fit parameters" button) to the experimental data, including experimental gamma-ray yields and branching ratios, lifetimes, mixing ratios and measured matrix elements, if they have been loaded.\nIf the fit does not converge in the default maximum number of steps, you can adjust the fit controls using option "f" in the "Gosia controls" button menu.\nThe final chi-squared value will be reported after a good fit is obtained, and you will have the option to keep the final matrix elements, or keep the original values.\nNote: If iterating the "corrected yields" and "fit" steps does not improve the chi-squared value, try running "Integrated yields."  In some cases, the full calculation will give a significantly better chi-squared minimum than the point approximation used in the fit.\nAfter fitting, you can (1) recalculate integrated yields, (2) run another fit, or (3) calculate the diagonal or correlated errors on the fitted matrix elements.\n1.  If you want to plot the yields corresponding to the fitted matrix element values, the integrated yields should be re-calculated with the new values of the matrix elements by running "Integrated yields," since the calculated yields in memory (if any) correspond to the old matrix element values before the fit.\n2.  If you want to iterate the fit, you should first iterate the "Make corrected yields" calculation using the new matrix element values.  You can also change fit limits on matrix elements before re-fitting.\n3.  To calculate diagonal or correlated errors on the matrix elements, select the appropriate function from the pull-down tab to the left of the Go button.

after_corrected_yields & DID YOU WRITE THE gosia.yld FILE AFTER SIMULATING OR LOADING DATA?\nIf you get errors in your fit, or inifinities in the corrected yields output (in the control panel textview), you probably need to rewrite the Gosia yield file.  Click "Write Gosia yld file."  Rachel should detect and report this error in the terminal window.\nThe "Make corrected yields" function generates adjusted yield data that correspond to point-scattering angle calculations (instead of a full integration).  These data are automatically stored in a corrected yields file.  The purpose of these corrected yields is to speed the fit by allowing Gosia to do fast point calculations at each step through the chi-squared surface.\nAfter running the corrected yields with the starting matrix element values, the normalization constants for each experiment should be calculated by running "Estimate normalizations."

after_simulted_yields & The "Make simulated yields" function produces a set of predicted gamma-ray yield data (with or without Gaussian scatter) using the current values of the matrix elements.  It also updates the calculated ("predicted") yields without random scatter.\nThese simulated data will be automatically saved to the Gosia yield file.\nAfter producing simulated data, you can plot the calculated yields and simulated data using the "Plot yields" button, or begin to fit matrix elements to the simulated data to 

import_yields_button & Once you answer the prompts to select the experiment, detector and yield data file, you can set this file as the "auto-load" file for this detector.  Then you will be able to load updated data for all detectors using the "al" command in the "Tools" button menu.\nAfter importing yield data for all Ge detectors in all experiments, be sure to pass the new data to Gosia using the button "Write Gosia yld file."  

default_stopping_power & Stopping powers have been calculated automatically to speed the initial setup.\nFor accurate calculations, you should check these stopping powers using the button "Stopping power".  This button will allow you to inspect and modify stopping power data.\nMore information\nThe Elast code used by this version of Rachel may give values that deviate by as much as 10--15% from SRIM calculations.

after_adding_experiment & After adding an experiment, you must add at least one Ge detector to it, in order to run a Gosia calculation.  This is done using either the "Attach/delete Ge dets." button or the "id" (import detectors) function in the "Tools" button menu.\nIf you have not already defined a physical crystal type, then you must do that first using either the "Define Ge det." button or the "ip" (import physical Ge types) function in the "Tools" button menu.

getting_started & To begin, either load a saved session you have already created using the button "Load session," or read a level scheme using the button "Read level scheme."  Supported level scheme file types are the Rachel text format* or the Radware .ags ascii level scheme format.\nMore information\nNote that some ENSDF Radware level schemes have missing spin or parity assignments.  These files cannot be read until the missing spin and parity assignments are added using Radware or a text editor.\nAlso, some ENSDF .ags files have bands containing same-spin or different-parity states.  These files cannot be read until same-spin or different-parity states are moved to different bands.\n\n*See the Gosia manual or the Gosia Wiki sections on Rachel.\nwww-user.pas.rochester.edu/~gosia/mediawiki

load_session & You can examine the setup in this saved session by clicking "Examine setup."\nMore information\nUpon loading a session, ALL levels are shown in red.\nAfter a Gosia calculation (integration, simulation, fit, etc.) levels shown in red in the level scheme represent isomers and levels which whose population cannot be calculated by Gosia.  In the latter case, this usually means that there are no matrix elements to populate those levels.\nIf a Gosia calculation was done in a previous session, you can restore the populated levels to black by clicking "Update LS window."

read_level_scheme & After reading a level scheme, you can merge bands if desired.  Usually, it is simpler to add matrix elements to large level schemes if you merge the even- and odd-spin members of a band into a single band.  To merge bands, enter the initial ("donor") band number and final ("recipient") band number into the "Initial/final band" entries and click "Merge bands."\nFor an initial calculation, you should add at least enough matrix elements to populate the initial state of the gamma decay used for normalization of yield data.  You will be prompted to define this transition later during the setup.\nThere are several ways to add matrix elements:\n1.  Add matrix elements using rotor models with the "Add/change m.e." button.\n2.  Add individual reduced matrix elements using the "Add <If||ML||Ii>" button.\n3.  Add all K-allowed E2, M1, E1 and E3 matrix elements using initial guesses at the moments by selecting "ka" from the "Tools" button menu.

add_me_button & If you have been fitting matrix elements, you should rewrite the yield data file (button "Write Gosia yld file") before the next fit and re-run "Make corrected yields."\nYou can display sets of matrix elements by clicking "Show m.e."\nAfter adding enough matrix elements to populate the desired levels, you can begin to define an experiment.  This is done interactively using the "Add/delete expt" button.\nIn Gosia, an experiment can mean either\n  an actual laboratory experiment whose particle-gamma data come from a single particle detector and its array of germaniums (defined separately)\n  a single particle detector, or\n  a partition of the data from one particle detector, such as a range of scattering angles, a set of rings of a CD, a sector of a CD, etc.


****something & (You must have enough matrix elements to populate the transition that you specified as the "normalization transition."  This transition is used by Gosia to normalize all experimental yield data, but must be defined to calculate yields.  You can change this transition using the button "Gosia controls," option "t.")

add_experiment & If you are using Rachel for the first time, you might try adding an annular detector (via prompts in the terminal) for a normal-kinematics experiment.\nAfter answering prompts to define the particle detector, the next step is usually to define a germanium detector.  If this is your first time, try using the "Define Ge det." button.

define_ge_button & This button allows you to define Ge crystal types.\nGe detectors of different "type" in Gosia terms represent either detectors with different geometries, or detectors placed at different distances from the target.\nTo attach the type(s) you define to an experiment, use the button "Attach/delete Ge dets."  You will then be able to attach detectors of the type(s) you have defined at different positions in the laboratory.\nMore information\nNote that you can define a detector type as an isotropic summed 4pi array to quickly calculate the 4pi gamma-ray yield for an experiment.\nIf you want to quickly define an array of different physical types, use the tools "ip" (import physical crystal types) and "id" (import detector arrays) in the "Tools" button menu.\nRefer to the Gosia Wiki for more information.\nwww-user.pas.rochester.edu/~gosia/mediawiki

attach_ge_button & This button allows you to attach Ge crystals (or a summed 4pi array) to one or more experiments.  After attaching at least one Ge detector to each experiment in memory, you can begin to run Gosia.  This button also allows you to define a summed "cluster" of Ge crystals.\nMore information\nThe first step in running Gosia is to select "Make Ge det file" (germanium detector file) from the first pull-down tab below the text window.  To generate the detector file, select "Run gosia input" from the next pull-down tab, then click "Go."\nTo set up a large array of crystals or clusters, try the tools "ip" (import physical crystal types) and "id" (import detector arrays) in the "Tools" button menu."\nNote that you are limited by Gosia to 32 data sets (crystal and/or cluster) per experiment.  The clusters can include as many as 200 individual crystals in total.\nRefer to the Gosia Wiki for more information.\nwww-user.pas.rochester.edu/~gosia/mediawiki

gdet_for_clusters & After adding cluster detectors or new detector types, be sure to remake the Gosia Ge detector file.  This is done by selecting "Make Ge det file" and "Run gosia input" in the pull-down tabs to the left of the "Go" button and clicking "Go."  (Cluster detectors require a special flag in the detector file.)

make_ge_det_file & After calling Gosia to create the Ge detector file, you can begin Coulomb excitation calculations.\nIf you have experimental data, you should load the data for all Ge detectors.  If you have set up the detectors to "auto-load," you can use the command "al" in the "Tools" button menu to load data for all detectors from the files you specified.  If you have not set up auto-loading, you can use the "Import yields" button.
