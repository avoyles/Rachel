# This detector array file defines 24 individual Miniball crystals for the
# Coulex@Miniball setup at REX-ISOLDE, all of the same physical type and
# distance from target.  The array configuration was provided by M. Albers at
# Cologne.
# 
# This file defines 24 detectors, each of which would have its own data
# partition.  Unused detectors should be removed or commented-out before
# loading this file.
#
# This definition would be useful for calculating angular distributions, as
# well as real data where statistics permit.
#
# Before loading this detector file, make sure that either 1. the crystal type
# "miniball" is defined in the session, or 2. the name "miniball" in this file
# is changed to match the name of the Miniball crystal type, if you have
# redefined the Miniball crystal physical type (e.g. to change the efficiency
# curve for a choice of absorbers, particle detectors, etc.)
