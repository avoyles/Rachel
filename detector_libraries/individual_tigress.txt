# This detector file represents the full Tigress array of 16 clovers detectors,
# as an individual detector with its own data partition.  Unused clovers should
# be commented-out before importing this array.
#
# This definition would be useful for calculating angular distributions, as
# well as real data where statistics permit.
#
# The crystal type "tigcrystal" is a cylinder approximation of a clover, i.e.
# representation of the clover as a single crystal.  When a more detailed
# definition of the array is available, a more accurate cluster-type definition
# of the array will be added to this library.
#
# Before loading this detector file, make sure that either 1. the crystal type
# "tigcrystal" is defined in the session as a Tigress clover, or 2. the name
# "tigcrystal" in this file is changed to matigcrystalh the name of the desired
# crystal type, if you have redefined the crystal type (e.g. to change the
# efficiency curve for a choice of absorbers, particle detectors, etigcrystal.)
