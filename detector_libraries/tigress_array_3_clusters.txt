# This detector file represents the Tigress array of 16 clovers detectors split
# into 3 clusters.  Unused clovers should be commented-out before importing
# this array.  (Change the number of crystals in each cluster to the actual
# number used.)
#
# The crystal type "tigcrystal" is a cylinder approximation of a clover, i.e.
# representation of the clover as a single crystal.  
#
# Before loading this detector file, make sure that either 1. the crystal type
# "tigcrystal" is defined in the session as a Tigress clover, or 2. the name "tigcrystal" in
# this file is changed to matigcrystalh the name of the desired crystal type, if you
# have redefined the crystal type (e.g. to change the efficiency curve for a
# choice of absorbers, particle detectors, etigcrystal.)
#
# Optional data file types ("txt" in this case) and data file names
# ("expt_1.txt") tell Rachel where to find data for "auto-loading."  If more
# than one experiment uses this array, additional copies of this file must be
# made, and the txt data file names must be changed so that they are unique in
# each copy for each Gosia experiment.  For example, the data file could be
# called expt_1_cluster.txt in one copy of this file and expt_2_cluster.txt in
# a second copy.
