Example 1 is 136 Xe on 184Ir (normal kinematics)

Example 2 is 25Ne on 208Pb   (normal kinematics)
    to demonstrate a test of adiabaticity problems for planning experiments or
    deciding if Gosia2008 is appropriate for the analysis

Example 3 is 184Ir on 12C (inverse kinematics)

    to demonstrate the issues with choosing beam or target detection
