Fast Setup:

Move into the directory containing this README file (the directory containing rachel.py).

Run the compile-all.sh script.  This is usually done by typing ./compile-all.sh .

This will compile the Gosia version distributed with Rachel, which is in the
gosia_source directory and the Elast version modified for command-line use by
J.M. Allmond, which is in the elast_source directory.

The compile-all script will also create a .rachel_setup file in the home
directory, which can be copied to another account and/or a working directory.  

./compile-all.sh clean will remove the compiled executables.

Thanks to Mitch Allmond for the compiling script.
